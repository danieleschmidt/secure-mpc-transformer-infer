## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our MPC implementation seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Responsible Disclosure

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@secure-mpc-transformer.org**

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, cryptographic weakness, protocol vulnerability)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days, we will provide an initial assessment
- **Updates**: We will send regular updates about our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure timing with you

### Security Measures

Our implementation includes several security measures:

#### Cryptographic Security
- **128-bit security level**: All protocols provide computational security equivalent to 128-bit keys
- **Secure random number generation**: Using cryptographically secure PRNGs
- **Constant-time algorithms**: Side-channel resistance for cryptographic operations
- **Memory protection**: Secure memory allocation and cleanup for sensitive data

#### Protocol Security
- **Malicious security**: Support for protocols secure against malicious adversaries
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation of all network inputs
- **Integrity checking**: MAC-based authentication of secret shares
- **Replay protection**: Nonce-based protection against replay attacks

#### System Security
- **Sandboxing**: Container-based isolation of MPC computations
- **Network security**: TLS encryption for all inter-party communication
- **Access control**: Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events

#### Development Security
- **Dependency scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Static analysis**: SAST tools for code quality and security
- **Container scanning**: Security scanning of Docker images
- **Secret detection**: Prevention of credentials in source code

### Security Testing

We encourage security research on our implementation:

#### Scope
- **In Scope**:
  - Cryptographic protocol implementations
  - Network communication security
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Memory safety and side-channel resistance
  - Container and deployment security

- **Out of Scope**:
  - Social engineering attacks
  - Physical attacks on hardware
  - Denial of service attacks
  - Issues in third-party dependencies (report to upstream)

#### Testing Guidelines
- Do not access or modify data without explicit permission
- Do not perform testing on production systems
- Respect system resources and other users
- Do not attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems

### Security Best Practices for Users

#### Deployment Security
```bash
# Use official Docker images with verified signatures
docker pull securempc/transformer-inference:latest

# Run with minimal privileges
docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp --tmpfs /var/tmp \
  securempc/transformer-inference:latest

# Use secure network communication
export MPC_TLS_CERT_PATH=/path/to/certs
export MPC_TLS_VERIFY_PEER=true
```

#### Configuration Security
```python
# Use secure configuration
config = SecurityConfig(
    protocol="malicious_3pc",  # Use malicious security
    security_level=128,        # Minimum 128-bit security
    tls_enabled=True,          # Enable TLS
    verify_integrity=True,     # Enable integrity checks
    secure_random=True         # Use secure randomness
)
```

#### Operational Security
- **Key Management**: Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for key storage
- **Network Security**: Deploy behind firewalls with restricted access
- **Monitoring**: Enable comprehensive security monitoring and alerting
- **Updates**: Keep all components updated with latest security patches

### Known Security Considerations

#### Current Limitations
- **Semi-honest vs Malicious**: Some protocols assume semi-honest adversaries
- **Network Security**: Basic implementations may use unencrypted channels
- **Side-channel Resistance**: GPU implementations may have timing variations
- **Scalability**: Large computations may reveal information through resource usage

#### Mitigations
- Use malicious-security protocols for production deployments
- Always enable TLS encryption for network communication
- Use constant-time GPU kernels where available
- Implement resource padding to hide computation patterns

### Security Roadmap

#### Planned Improvements
- **Formal Verification**: Cryptographic proofs of security properties
- **Advanced Protocols**: Zero-knowledge proof integration
- **Hardware Security**: Intel SGX and AMD SEV support
- **Differential Privacy**: Built-in privacy budget management
- **Post-Quantum Security**: Quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives
