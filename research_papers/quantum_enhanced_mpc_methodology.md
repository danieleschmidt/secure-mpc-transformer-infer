# Methodology and Experimental Design: Quantum-Enhanced MPC Validation

## Abstract

This document details the comprehensive experimental methodology for validating quantum-enhanced secure multi-party computation (MPC) algorithms. Our approach follows rigorous academic standards for reproducible research, including statistical significance testing, effect size analysis, and proper experimental controls.

## 1. Experimental Design Framework

### 1.1 Research Questions

Our validation addresses the following key research questions:

1. **RQ1**: Do quantum-enhanced MPC algorithms provide statistically significant performance improvements over classical baselines?
2. **RQ2**: How do quantum optimizations scale with increasing problem complexity and party count?
3. **RQ3**: What are the security vs. performance trade-offs in quantum-enhanced MPC protocols?
4. **RQ4**: What convergence properties do quantum optimization algorithms exhibit in MPC contexts?

### 1.2 Experimental Variables

**Independent Variables:**
- Algorithm type (classical_baseline, quantum_vqe, adaptive_quantum, hybrid_quantum_classical, post_quantum_secure)
- Dataset characteristics (size, complexity, domain)
- Quantum parameters (depth, entanglement layers, variational steps)
- Security parameters (security level, post-quantum enabled, malicious security)
- Scalability parameters (party count, input size)

**Dependent Variables:**
- Performance metrics (latency, throughput, memory usage)
- Quality metrics (accuracy, convergence rate)
- Security metrics (security score, quantum advantage)
- Resource metrics (CPU utilization, energy consumption)

**Control Variables:**
- Hardware configuration (standardized across experiments)
- Random seeds (controlled for reproducibility)
- Runtime limits (consistent timeout policies)
- Environmental conditions (isolated execution environments)

### 1.3 Experimental Design

We employ a **factorial experimental design** with the following structure:

```
Experiment = Algorithm × Dataset × Parameters × Repetitions
```

- **Algorithms**: 5 different approaches
- **Datasets**: 4 synthetic + 1 real-world dataset
- **Parameter Combinations**: Generated via ParameterGrid
- **Repetitions**: 10-15 per combination (sufficient for statistical power)

## 2. Statistical Analysis Methodology

### 2.1 Hypothesis Testing

For each performance comparison, we test:

**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No significant difference between quantum and classical algorithms
**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Quantum algorithms show significant improvement

**Significance Level**: α = 0.05 (with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons)

### 2.2 Statistical Tests

We employ appropriate statistical tests based on data distribution:

**Normality Testing:**
- Shapiro-Wilk test for sample sizes < 50
- Anderson-Darling test for larger samples

**Parametric Tests (for normal data):**
- Welch's t-test (unequal variances assumed)
- Paired t-test for before/after comparisons

**Non-parametric Tests (for non-normal data):**
- Mann-Whitney U test for independent samples
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples
- Friedman test for multiple algorithm comparisons

### 2.3 Effect Size Analysis

We compute **Cohen's d** for effect size quantification:

```
d = (μ₁ - μ₂) / σ_pooled
```

Where:
- μ₁, μ₂ are sample means
- σ_pooled is pooled standard deviation

**Effect Size Interpretation:**
- Small effect: d = 0.2
- Medium effect: d = 0.5  
- Large effect: d = 0.8

### 2.4 Multiple Comparison Correction

To control family-wise error rate across multiple comparisons:

**Bonferroni Correction:**
```
α_corrected = α / n_comparisons
```

**False Discovery Rate (FDR):**
- Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for less conservative control

### 2.5 Confidence Intervals

We compute 95% confidence intervals for all metrics using:

**For means:**
```
CI = x̄ ± t_(α/2,df) × (s/√n)
```

**For differences:**
```
CI_diff = (x̄₁ - x̄₂) ± t_(α/2,df) × SE_diff
```
