# CI/CD Requirements Documentation

This document outlines the required GitHub Actions workflows for the secure MPC transformer inference project.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Code Quality and Testing (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests
**Purpose**: Ensure code quality and run comprehensive tests

**Required Steps**:
```yaml
- Setup Python 3.10+
- Install dependencies (CPU and GPU variants)
- Run linting (black, ruff, mypy)
- Execute unit tests with coverage
- Run integration tests (if GPU available)
- Security scan for vulnerabilities
- Upload coverage reports
```

**Environment Variables**:
- `CUDA_VERSION`: For GPU-enabled tests
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: Python version matrix

### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push to main, daily schedule
**Purpose**: Scan for security vulnerabilities and secrets

**Required Steps**:
```yaml
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (Snyk/Safety)
- Secret detection (GitLeaks)
- Container image scanning
- SAST analysis (CodeQL)
- License compliance check
```

### 3. Performance Benchmarking (`benchmark.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push to main, performance label on PR
**Purpose**: Track performance regressions

**Required Steps**:
```yaml
- Setup GPU environment
- Run standard benchmarks
- Compare against baseline
- Generate performance report
- Comment results on PR
```

**Hardware Requirements**:
- GPU runner with CUDA support
- Minimum 24GB VRAM
- High-speed network for multi-party tests

### 4. Documentation (`docs.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push to main, docs changes
**Purpose**: Build and deploy documentation

**Required Steps**:
```yaml
- Build documentation (Sphinx/MkDocs)
- Generate API documentation
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Update protocol specifications
```

### 5. Release (`release.yml`)

**Triggers**: Tagged releases
**Purpose**: Build and publish releases

**Required Steps**:
```yaml
- Build Python packages
- Build Docker images
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Publish to PyPI
- Push Docker images to registry
- Create GitHub release with assets
```

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management

**Required Secrets**:
- `PYPI_TOKEN`: For package publishing
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` / `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Container registry
- `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`: For signing releases
- `SECURITY_EMAIL`: For automated security notifications

### Access Controls

- Require approval for deployment workflows
- Restrict secret access to main branch only
- Use OIDC for cloud provider authentication
- Implement branch protection rules

## Environment Setup

### Runner Requirements

**Standard Runners**:
```yaml
ubuntu-latest:
  - CPU-only tests
  - Documentation builds
  - Security scans

self-hosted-gpu:
  - GPU-accelerated tests
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Integration tests
```

**Container Requirements**:
```yaml
ubuntu-22.04:
  cuda: "12.0"
  python: "3.10"
  memory: "64GB"
  gpu_memory: "24GB"
```

### Dependency Caching

```yaml
- Python dependencies (pip cache)
- CUDA toolkit cache
- Pre-built Docker layers
- Test data and models
```

## Workflow Templates

### Basic CI Template Structure
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.10, 3.11]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
      - name: Run linting
      - name: Run tests
      - name: Upload coverage
```

### Security Workflow Template
```yaml
name: Security
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'
jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run security scan
      - name: Check for secrets
      - name: Vulnerability assessment
```

## Integration Requirements
